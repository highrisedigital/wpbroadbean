Simple integration of Broadbean job posting & distribution with WordPress.

== Description ==

*This plugin is no longer being developed or maintained. We recommend [JobRelay](https://jobrelay.io) for integrating WordPress with Broadbean.

The WP Broadbean plugin provides **developers** with a scaffolding to integrate Broadbean with a WordPress website. The plugin is not a plug-and-play solution but offers the tools needed to get started integrating a WordPress website with Broadbean.

Once successfully integrated jobs written in Broadbean appear in WordPress and applications to jobs on WordPress are tracked back to Broadbean.
